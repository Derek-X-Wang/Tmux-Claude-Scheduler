# Window Management

The window system is at the heart of TCS, automatically discovering and managing your tmux windows.

## Quick Start

List all discovered windows:
```bash
tcs windows list
```

## Understanding Window Targets

TCS uses a `session:window` format for targeting:
- `project:0` - Window 0 in session "project"
- `work:2` - Window 2 in session "work"

## Common Tasks

### Schedule a message to a specific window
```bash
tcs message add project:0 "Hello Claude!" --when "in 5 minutes"
```

### View messages for a window
```bash
tcs message list --window project:0
```

## Pro Tips

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Use tab completion to quickly select windows
ðŸš€ **Power User**: Set window priorities for automatic scheduling
```

Documentation principles:
- Start with why, then how
- Show, don't just tell
- Include realistic examples
- Anticipate common questions
- Keep it scannable

Your goal is to create documentation that turns confused users into confident power users, reducing support burden while enabling feature discovery.
